# Data Science Projects
These are some of the projects that I have worked on:

## PwC Power BI Job Simulation
This was a job simulation conducted by PwC Switzerland in data visualization using Power BI. It comprised of three tasks:

- Task 1 - Dashboard: Creating a dashboard for a call centre
- Task 2 - Customer Retention: Find out why customers are leaving the telecom
- Task 3 - HR: Creating dashboards to investigate the diversity at different levels of the organisation

## Python API
This was a project that involved creating a Python API that has 3 endpoints:
+ Scrape the given URL and store the data
+ Extract text from a PDF and store the text
+ Chat for querying about the data stored in the previous 2 steps
It also contains a Jupyter notebook containing analysis pertaining to web traffic data.
